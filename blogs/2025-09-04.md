# A Very Interesting Tell-all!

One might ask what a very interesting tell-all might include. How interesting could a tell-all be? What tales and follies might be included? What may not be included? The best tell-alls are the most simple ones. But one must develop a tell-all with the goal of being very interesting as well. As much as this may be considered complete and utter nonsense, the bigger fool would be the person reading this garbage -- spending valuable seconds of their life looking at a very unimportant github repo. Yet again, they recommend to "not suffer fools gladly"...that's all for this test blurb!
